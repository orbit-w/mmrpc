# MM RPC
MM RPC(Multi-Senders:Multi-Receivers) is a RPC(Remote procedure call) library for Golang.

Suitable for remote calls between services within the cluster,
it can also be used for message communication between intranet services

The StreamTransport transport layer relies on TCP underlying connections to provide reliability and ordering
and to provide stream-oriented multiplexing.
